Scriptname SOTC:ActorGroupLoadoutScript extends ObjectReference
{ Used to define a unique loadout of NPC variants for an Actor type. }
;Written by SMB92
;Special thanks to J. Ostrus [BigandFlabby] for code contributions that made this mod possible.

;This script is mostly storage for an array of ActorBase (LvlNPCs) that can be used to create custom
;squads/groups of NPCs to spawn. Can be used as many times as necessary and placed into multiple
;ClassPresetScript instances.

;LEGEND - PREFIX CONVENTION
; Variables and Properties are treated the same. Script types do not have prefixes, unless they
;are explicitly received as function arguments and are multi-instance scripts.
; "a" - (Function/Event Blocks only) Variable was received as function argument OR the variable
;was created from a passed-in Struct/Var[] member
; "k" - Is an "Object" as usual, whether created in a Block or defined in the empty state/a state.
; "f,b,i,s" - The usual Primitives: Float, Bool, Int, String.

;PROPERTIES & IMPORTS

Group Primary

	ActorBase[] Property kGroupUnits Auto Const Mandatory
	{ Fill with ActorBase intended for this Actor Type and Class }

	ActorBase[] Property kBossGroupUnits Auto Const Mandatory
	{ Fill with ActorBase intended for this Actor Type and Class }

	Bool Property bHasPowerArmorUnits Auto Const Mandatory
	{ If either ActorBase array above has PA Units, sets this true } 

	Bool[] Property bClassesToApply Auto Mandatory ;SEE NOTES BELOW Mandatory
	{ Initialise members True on index matching ID No. of Classes this group can be added to.
Set false for Classes not desired. Only add to Classes that exist for this Actor. }
	;NOTE: THIRD PARTY MODS can modify this property directly if they want, but it is left Const so
	;that the value will be updated upon a reshuffle.
	;REFERENCE LEGEND - CLASSES
	; [0] - DEBUG (Typically "Common" Class Preset with 100% chance always)
	; [1] - COMMON, REGULAR SPAWN CLASS
	; [2] - UNCOMMON, REGULAR SPAWN CLASS
	; [3] - RARE, REGULAR SPAWN CLASS
	; [4] - AMBUSH CLASS
	; [5] - SNIPER CLASS
	;Note: Not all Actors have to support each Class. Fill accordingly.
	
	Int Property iPlayerLevelRestriction Auto ;Can be modified from Menu. 
	{ If wanting to restrict this group from appearing while Player is below a certain level, set this value accordingly. }
	
	Bool Property bHasOversizedRegularUnits Auto Const
	{ If the Regular Units list contains "Oversized" actors (that would be unsafe for confined spaces), flag this True. }
	
	Bool Property bHasOversizedBossUnits Auto Const
	{ If the Boss Units list contains "Oversized" actors (that would be unsafe for confined spaces), flag this True. }

;RETURN FUNCTIONS
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;Return one of the above Grouplists. Used rarely from this script, if at all. Best to get from

;DEV NOTE: This function does not consider if Group has oversized actors or not as it is there is
;no failback if it does (it would have to return None.). Use ClassPresetScript function instead.
